 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this page, i would like to share my journey of education.First of all, i get my early education at Jack & Jill Kindergarten,Kota Bharu,Kelantan.Next, i further my studies at Pa'Pura primary school and continues my secondary school at Sultan Ismail secondary school since i had passed UPSR in good result.</p>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During SPM,it was my fortune as i got 3B 6C in my SPM and got a study offer to UiTM Machang in pre diploma in commerce at first which is an interview course.At first,i am quite nervous since i know furthering studies at university is not as secondary school.Then, in the thrid phase of interview , i had a bit failure so i think i cannot further studies there but after that i got the offer letter at the same university but in Information Management.After that ,my parents persued me and told me it is my luck and wants me to further my studies at UITM. </p>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Till then, i decided continues my studies UITM Machang in Information Management. Alhamdulillah, it is my fortune at UITM.i got 3.2 during for every semester and and also got dean list during fourth semester..i hope i can end my diploma with a success and a  great CGPA.</p>
