 <p>&nbsp &nbsp Firstly, in this page i would like to share a little bit about my family.I have 9 members of family all together.I am really blessed and grateful because i have a very supportive parents.My father's name is Tuan Rosli Bin Tuan Ismail and is a bussinessman.Next,my mother's name is Siti Nor Bt Jusoh who is a fully housewife.After that,my grandmother's name who is Tuan Som Bt Tuan Mat also stays with me.</p>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp In addition,i have 6 siblings all together which consists of 4 girls and 2 boys.Speaking of my eldest sister,She is 22 years old and still futhering her studies at University Sains Malaysia while i am 21 years old and  studying for final semester in Information Management at UITM.Instead of that , my third siblings is studying in form 5 and the forth one is form 2.I have 2 little brothers which is 9 years old and 5 years old. </p>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp Briefly, i really loves my family so much and always pray to Allah bless us and grant a success for us to repay all my parents kindness to us.During our leisure time, we always discuss, talks and sharing stories together to release our stress. Essentially,my parents always decided to travel once a year to spend time our together. </p>
