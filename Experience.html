 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Experience ? Yes i have many experiences that i would like to share here...Actually im a a very adventureous person since i like to ride a horse.For me, riding a horse is a very good activity because it such a therapy of our mind.Basically, i riding a horse at seaside or at Polo Backhorse riding with my members.Instead of that, i had joined many volunteerism programmes such as "gotong royong" at Pantai Senok or any other sea.I am really like to join such programme since it can gain my knowledge,improves my soft skills and works in teammates.</p>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In addition,during my studies at UITM,i experienced on participated public speaking competition.Next, i also had worked as a salesgirls after SPM.Here, i learn new things and realised how to earn our own money.I also had worked as temporary reporter at Malaysia Timeline,Kota Bharu. </p>
